## Part 2. Open-Ended Questions (3 items)

### 1. Describe the most challenging or interesting project you have coded

Explain:  

- What business problem it solved  
- Your role in the project  
- Technical difficulties you faced and how you overcame them  
- If it was a team project, describe your contribution and how the collaboration was organized  

Include as many links as possible:  

- Source code on GitHub  
- Project landing pages  
- Certificates / awards (if submitted to competitions)  
- Presentations, photos of development or defense, etc.  

You can also include links to achievements that showcase you in a positive light:  

- Interesting projects, hackathons, competitions, courses  
- Certificates, publications (e.g., on Habr)  
- Resume

### 2. Developer Contribution Metrics

Our project aims to evaluate developer contribution on GitHub, but simple commit counts or pull requests do not fully reflect real contribution.  

Think about which indicators and metrics could help measure a developer’s activity and value. Examples:  

- Number of bugs fixed  
- Code quality and size  
- Participation in reviews  
- Opened/closed issues  
- Discussion activity  
- Commit regularity  

Describe which metrics you would propose, why, which aspects of developer work they reflect, and how they could be collected using tools like the GitHub API.

### 3. Project Architecture

Imagine the architecture of our project:  

- Core (library for calculating metrics)  
- CLI utility  
- Web API  
- Telegram bot  

Describe how you would split the code between these components:  

- What belongs in the core  
- What belongs in the interfaces  
- How they interact with each other  

Optionally, you can include a diagram of the architecture and attach a link.
