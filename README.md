HR processes and IT management are getting more complex. A key challenge is evaluating developers across multiple dimensions: productivity, code quality, skills, and contribution — all of which are hard to measure without clear metrics.

This project will build a practical system to assess developer or team contributions based on GitHub activity. The system consists of: a Python library for calculating contribution metrics, a CLI for accessing the library’s functionality, and a Telegram bot for convenient interaction.

Students will learn how to design and structure code across multiple components, apply testing and CI/CD practices, handle secrets, write clear documentation, and automate deployment. The project emphasizes real-world Open Source practices, from version control and pull requests to creating attractive READMEs and managing releases.

Although similar tools exist, this project focuses on improving usability, adding meaningful features, and producing a clean, modular, and well-documented solution that can be used and extended by the developer community.
